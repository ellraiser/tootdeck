The aim of tootdeck is to make an easy to use web client for mastodon that's easy enough for new tooters to come along and just get stuck into a bunch of communities, as well as old tooters having all the functionality they'd want across multiple instances.

@ me over on @ellraiser@mastodon.social or @ellraiser@mastodon.art!

Currently a work in progress, these are still things I want to get done for the 1.0:
