# tootdeck
Yo!

The aim of tootdeck is to make an easy to use web client for mastodon that's easy enough for new tooters to come along and just get stuck into a bunch of communities, as well as old tooters having all the functionality they'd want across multiple instances.

Currently a work in progress, these are still things I want to get done for the 1.0:

Toots
- Content warnings + spoilers
- Polls (see/vote/post)
- Attachments
- Delete toot/reply
- Alt text for images (media.description)
- Schedule + Scheduled Toots

Profile
- "My" Profile pages
- Followers / Following / Posts
- Pinned Toots? (/api/v1/accounts/:id/pin)
- "More toots pls" for profiles
- don't show follow on urself u eejit

General
- shorten fav/boost/comment to k/m if over 999
- Show "My" notifications somewhere
- Cap header to content width
- Github links

Search
- search results + filters

Communities
- Notifications counter per community
- reorder communities on LHS
- set "default" landing community + save

Federation
- Boost/comment/follow using different accounts
